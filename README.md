# 🍔 Food Delivery Demand Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

Food delivery platforms must accurately predict customer demand to manage delivery partners, prepare restaurants, and reduce delays.  
If demand is underestimated, customers face long waiting times. If overestimated, resources are wasted.

This project focuses on analyzing historical food delivery order data to understand demand patterns and predict future order volumes, helping platforms improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze past food order trends  
- Identify peak demand times and locations  
- Understand factors affecting order volume  
- Predict future food delivery demand  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical records of food delivery orders including:

- Order timestamps  
- Delivery zones or locations  
- Restaurant categories  
- Order counts or volumes  
- Other operational features affecting demand  

Each row represents food delivery activity during a specific time period and area.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Import historical food order data  
- Inspect dataset structure  

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing or incorrect timestamps  
- Standardize location and category names  
- Remove duplicate records  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extract date and time features (day, hour, weekday)  
- Create demand-based indicators  
- Aggregate orders by time and zone  

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze demand by time of day  
- Study demand across locations  
- Identify peak ordering periods  

### 5. Model Preparation
- Prepare features for prediction  
- Split data into training and testing sets  

### 6. Demand Prediction
- Train machine learning models to estimate order demand  
- Evaluate prediction performance
